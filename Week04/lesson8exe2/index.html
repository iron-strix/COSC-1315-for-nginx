        <p><strong>The Milky Way Galaxy</strong> is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing
            the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot
            be individually distinguished by the naked eye.</p>

        <p>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated visible diameter of 100,000â€“200,000 light-years. Recent
            simulations suggest that a dark matter disk, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of
            almost 2 million light-years.</p>
